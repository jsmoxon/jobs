Hi,


I'm Geofrey Ernest . or @gernest here. I am go developer based in Tanzania. I saw the job posing on golangprojects.com and I believe Iam the right man for the Job.


I am the author of utron framework https://github.com/gernest/utron, I have authored tools/libraries that are used in prodution, the list will be too long for the scope of this email. Just some highlight

- orm https://github.com/ngorm
- router https://github.com/gernest/alien
- fun stuff /spinners for cli https://github.com/gernest/wow 
 And many more because I love tooling a lot.

I have been searching for a Go job for a while, so while doing that I am actually working on a real project of mine you can track progress here https://github.com/gernest/bq
 It is a full featured qrcode service that leverages the power of distributed  docker swarm to offer reliable API, I haven't released it yet but I use a lot of techniques to make sure the service performs as expected.

I am not algorithm wizard, and I will appreciate if we don't move forward in case you are looking for someone proficient in algorithms to save our times.

Regards,

Geofrey
